//Instructions:

// Can you find after how many years will a person's birthday fall on the same day of the week that he was born?
// For example, Joy's birthday is on 16th October, 1990 which falls on Friday. 
// After how many years will his birthday fall on Friday again? (That would be 11 years)
// nextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(1990, 10, 16)) //11
// nextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(2012, 5, 20))  //6
// nextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(1975, 2, 22))  //5


// My Answer:

let nextBirthdayOfTheWeek = function(birthday) {
    let weekday = birthday.getDay();
    let yr = birthday.getFullYear();
    yr += 1;
    let month = birthday.getMonth();
    let day = birthday.getDate();
    
    while( weekday !== new Date( yr, month, day ).getDay() ){
      yr++;
    }
    return yr - birthday.getFullYear();
  }
  
  
  // Best Practice:
  
  // var nextBirthdayOfTheWeek = function(birthday) {
  //   var dow = birthday.getDay(), bYear = birthday.getFullYear();
  //   do birthday.setFullYear(birthday.getFullYear() + 1);
  //   while(birthday.getDay() != dow);
  //   return birthday.getFullYear() - bYear;
  // };
