// Instructions:

// Input
// a string strng of n positive numbers (n = 0 or n >= 2)
// Let us call weight of a number the sum of its digits. 
// For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1.
// Two numbers are "close" if the difference of their weights is small.

// Task:
// For each number in strng calculate its "weight" and then find two 
// numbers of strng that have:
// the smallest difference of weights ie that are the closest
// with the smallest weights
// and with the smallest indices (or ranks, numbered from 0) in strng

// Output:
// an array of two arrays, each subarray in the following format:
// [number-weight, index in strng of the corresponding number, 
// original corresponding number instrng]
// or a pair of two subarrays (Haskell, Clojure, FSharp) 
// or an array of tuples (Elixir, C++)
// or a (char*) in C mimicking an array of two subarrays
// or a matrix in R (2 rows, 3 columns, no columns names)
// The two subarrays are sorted in ascending order by their number weights 
// if these weights are different, by their indexes in the string 
// if they have the same weights.
